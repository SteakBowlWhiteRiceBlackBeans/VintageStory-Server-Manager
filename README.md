How to Install and use - 

Download the latest release DSM.zip
-Unzip the folder into a folder to any location you desire
-Launch the server manager .exe
-Open the Settings and validate the server executable is set correct, if not go ahead and browse to set it
-If you wish to use a abnormal server data location, change the VIntageStoryServerData folder location.
-If you also wish to set any launch parameters, do that now.
-Adjust any other settings such as auto saving or auto backup (Yes VS already does but I dont trust it)
-Hit save then go back and start the server
